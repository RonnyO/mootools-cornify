Mootools port of [Paul Irish's Cornami.js](http://paulirish.com/2009/cornify-easter-egg-with-jquery/), a cheerful konami-code easter-egg jQuery plugin.
Just link the script or paste its minified version in your pages to add happyness to the interwebz.

MooTools Cornify comes in three flavors
--
* mootools-cornify.js is the canonical script - Just like on yayQuery.com, only in MooTools
* mootools-cornify-readable.js is more, well, readable - Take a peek if you don't get WTH is going on.
* mootools-cornify-min.js is tiny, and you'll probably want to embed its content in your pages, as seen on demo-better-performance.html
